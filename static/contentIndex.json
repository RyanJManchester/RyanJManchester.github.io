It has two lobes, the anterior and posterior, which haver very different functions\n\n\nThe Pituitary Gland releases Nine hormones into the blood stream for circulation. one of these is the antidurietic hormone, ADH.\nADH is released in response to a fall in blood pressure or blood volume, such as is seen in hypovolaemic shock. It Works by reducing the amount of water from being excreted at the kidneys which will increase blood volume, and by causing peripheral vasoconstriction which increase blood pressure.\ngraph TD\nG[Decreased blood pressure] --&gt; A\nH[Decreased blood volume] --&gt; A\n\n  A[Hypothalamus]--&gt; f[Posterior Pituitary] --&gt;B[Anti-diuretic hormone ADH]--&gt; C[Blood vessels \\n- constriction]-- Increased systemic \\nvascular resistance --&gt; E[Increased Arterial Pressure]\n  B --&gt; D[Kidneys \\n - fluid reabsorption] -- Increased blood volume--&gt; E\n\n\n\nThe Adrenal Glands\nThe Adrenal glands are small structures attached to the top of each kidney.\nEach gland is divided into two parts: the Adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla, and each part has seperate endocrine functions.\n\n\nThe Adrenal Cortex\nThe adrenal cortex produces several steroid hormones, known as corticosteroids.\nThe two main hormones produced by the adrenal cortez are aldosterone and cortisol.\n\nAldesterone Helps to regulate the blood pressure by maintaining the body’s salt and water levels. It plays an important role in the body’s response to shock. Without aldosterone, the body would become severly dehydrated.\nCortisol\nis also known as a hydrocortisone, and the ‘stress’ hormone. It is involved in the flight or fight response, helps to regulate metabolism, and has anti-aging properties.\n\n\n\nThe Adrenal Medulla\nproduces hormones known as catecholamines.\nAdrenaline and noradrenaline are both produced by the adrenal medulla.\nAlthough released at a slow rate continously, the rate of release is dramatically increased with sympathetic nervous system stimulation.\nThese two hormones are responsible for the phyioslogical signs of the stress response such as tachycardia, increased blood pressure, tachypnoea, and pale, cool, sweaty skin.\nHypoAdrenal Shock\nA complication we occasionally see is hypoadrenal shock, or adrenal crisis, sometimes known as Addisonian’s crisis. It is cause by inadequate levels of circulating cortisol. Some clinical conditions may result in abnormal adrenal function and low levels of cortisol producion. For these patients, the body is unable to release additional cortisol when a stress response is required,\nThis places these patients at risk of Hypoadreanl Shock.\nthey will offten have extra medication at home and instructions on when to take this. Personnel are encourage to folow these instructions and to call clinical desk (0800 111 help) for further advice).\n\n\nThe Thyroid gland\nlocated just in front of the trachea, below the thyroid cartilae, the maiun function of the thyroid gland is to regulate metabolism.\nThyroid disdynctuin is relatively common in NZ. the two main conditions seen are hyper thyroidism and hypothyroidism.\nThe Pancreas\nThe pancreas is approximaately 15-25cm in length and rests just inder the stomach in the epigastrum of the abdominal cavity.\nApproximately 98% of the pancreas is composed of exocrine cells whic secrete enzymes to break down proteins, fat, and carbohydrates in food. The remaining 2% of the pancreas is composed of endocrine cells. These are clusters of cels called pancreatic islets, aslo known as the islets of Langerhan’s. These endocrine cels secrete hormones directly into nearbyblood vessels for systemic distribtuion, including glucagon and insulin\nHypoThyroidism\noften treatted with a medication called thyroxine,\nHyperThyroidism\ntreatment options include medication and surgical options.\n\n\n                  \n                   Neither\n                  \n                \n\n\nof these thyroid conditions are directly treatable in our out of hospital setting, although it may be necessary to treat resulting symptoms which occur as a result.\n\n\n\nGland\nThe\nDiabietes Mellitus\nAcute Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nChronic Complications of Diabetes Meliitus\nReview Questions\n\n\nWhat are parts of the endocrine System?\nThe endocrine system includes the:\n\nHypothalamus\nPituitary gland\nAdrenal Glands\nThyroid Gland\nPancreas\nThe pineal gland\nthymus\ntestes or ovaries\nHPATPTTT\n\n\n\nWhat Conditions can affect the endocrine System?\n\n"},"Module-2/Human-Factors":{"slug":"Module-2/Human-Factors","filePath":"Module 2/Human Factors.md","title":"Human Factors","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  What does this paper aim to achieve? \n                  \n                \n\n\nThis paper aims to get you to focus on and remember 5 Principles that help you effective manage yourself and crew members.\n\n\n\nThe 5 principles outlined , in DETAIL, are:\n\n\nCall For Help when Required.

Not all patients will experience adverse effects and when we want to consider administering a medication we need to consider is possible adverse affects are worth achieving the desired result of the medicine.BioAvailabilityBioavailability is the percentage of a medication that reaches the systemic circulation umetabolised for the body to use therapeutically. Medications given Intravaneously have a much higher bio-availability than those given orally. This is due to first-pass metabolism.Duration of effectThe length / amount of time a medication remains above the minimum concentration levels.  (eg, Ondansetron duration of effect is 4 - 8 hrs).Half - lifeis the time take for the plasma concentration to fall by one half. Medicines with short half lives leave the body quickly, whereas medicines with long half-lives leave the body slowly.InteractionInteraction can occur when the interaction of one medication alters the clinical effects of another. This may result in an increase or decrease in either beneficial or harmful effects of either Medication.Mechanism of ActionDescribes how the medication has it’s effect.  For example, Ondansetron, an antiemetic, blocks (antagonizes) serotonin receptors centrally in the brain and perpherally in the GI Tract, resulting in a reduction in nausea and vomiting.(MEC): Minimum Effective Concentration(MEC) the lowest concentration of the medicine required to achieve the therapeutic benefit.(MTC) Maximum Therapeutic ConcentrationIs the concentration at which a medicine produces unwanted adverse effects. It is also known as a minimum toxic concentration.Onset of Effectthe length of time it takes for a medicine to become effective - and it is dependent on the route of administration.Peak ConcentrationPeak concentration refers to peak plasma levels and is the highest level of medicine concentration in the blood. For example, pleak plasma concentration of Ondansetron following a 4mg intramuscular dose is attained after approximately 4 minutes.PharmacoKineticsIs what the body does to the medicine, and the is concerned with the MOI, where and how a medicine asserts its affects, and the associated body’s pharmalogical response.PharmacodynamicsIs what the medicine does to the body. Pharmacodynamics is concerned with how medicines enter the body and their movement through it until eliminated.\nExpanding on our Terms Above\nMultiple Dosing, Why?\nwe dose multiple times to maintain a steady concentration of a medication to maintain optimum effectiveness, such as pain relief. for epilepsy, or chronic diseases.\nAfter the administration of a single dose, the medication concentration in the plasma rises above and then falls below the MEC - Minimum effective concentration, resulting in a decline in therapeutic effort. Multiple Doses are used to maintain a steady concentration of the medication, to achieve optimum affectiveness.\nMaximum Therapeutic Concentration.\nMaximum therapeutic concentraition, also known as the minimum toxic concentration, is the concentration at which a medication starts producing unwanted adverse effects.\nMedicines with a short half-life leave the body quickly whereas medicines with long half-lives leave the body slowly.\nOnset Of Effect\nOnset Of Effect: the length of time it takes for a medication to have effects on the body, and is dependent on the route of administration.\nPharmacodynamics vs\nis What medicine does to the body.

Pharmacoknetics is concerned with how medicines enter the body and their movement through the body until eliminated.\nwhat the body does to the medicine\nit includes (A,B,C,D) - administration, bioavailability, clearance, and distribution\n💡 Why is pharmacokinetics important?\nBy understanding pharmacokinetic principles, medicine therapy can be maximised to enhance benefits and Hamrm, through informed decisions.\nFactors affecting pharmacokinetics\n\nAge: An elder person may have slower G.I Activity, and this can increase absorption\nPhysiological Alterations to the body, such as increased adipose (fat) tissue, can affect distribution, and clearance of medicine of the body.\nDisease processes which affect liver and kidney functions - the organs of medicine elimination - are responsible for large variances in pharmacokinetics.\nDiminished vascular perfusion of one or more parts of the body is encountered in conditions such as cardiac failure. This diminished perfusion can affect the different pharmacokinetic mechanisms:\n\nperfusion of the absorption site influence absorption\nvariation of the liver and kidneys affects the metabolism and excretion of the medication\nvariation of body perfusion may alter distribution to certain organs.\n\n\nBody Size may alse affect liver and kidney function,, with obesity believed to increase clearance of medicines.\n\nRoutes Of Administration - Parental Vs Enteral\nParental Routes - bypass the GI Tract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Medication givenTime for RouteIntravenousIntraosseous (into a bone)IntramuscularSubcutaneous  (under the skin)Inhalation or NebulisedTopical  (local to site required)Intranasal\nEnteral routes - absorption through the G.I Tract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Medication givenTime for RoutePer OralOrogastic / nasogastric  via a tube inserted into the stimach via the mouth or nose.Per Rectum  into the rectumBuccal  (between gum and cheek)Sublingual  (under the tongue)\nThe life-cycle of medicines in the body\nAbsorption\nThe passage of medicine from the site of administration into the bloodstream.For example, a medication adminstered per Oral (PO) is absorbed from the stomach and / or intestine into the portal (liver) circulation, and a medicine that is administered intramuscularly (IM) is absorbed from the muscle into the systemic circulation. Absorption occurs by active or passive transport.\nThe bodys environment into which the medicine is administered, along with the chemical composition of the medicine, work together to determine the rate and extent of medicine absorption. The rate of abosrption determins how soon the medicine will produce its effects and the amount of medicine absorption determines how intense the effects are.\nFactors influencing BioAvailibility\nBlood Flow\nThe more blood flow to the tissue at the absorption site, the faster the medication is absorbed. Fir example, When a patient is shocked, The blood flow to the GastroIntestinal Tract is reduced, and therefore Oral Medication would be less effective. However, Absorption is not Required when a medicine is administered intravenously, as the medication directly enters the bloodstream\ngraph TD\n  A[Pt is in Shock,\\n Less blood flow]\n  A -- less blood flow to GI Tract.--&gt; B\n  A -- Normal access Intravenously --&gt; C\n  B[Oral Medications Not as Effective]\n  C[Intravenous Medications Still Work The Same]\n\nSurface Area for Absorption\nThe larger the surface area, the faster the absorption. For Example, a Patient who has had a section of their bowel surgically removed due to Chron’s Disease would have a slower rate of absorption than a Pt with an intact bowel due to decrease surface area.\nShown Above: Villi, the finger line projections within the GI Tract that increase the surface area availble for absorption.\nLipid Water Solubility\nBecause Cell Membranes are lipiod (fat), The greater the lipid-solubility of a medication, The Faster the absorption.\nIt is also easier for smaller molecules to penetrate and be absorbed by cell membranes than larger molecules.\nPH of Medications\nMost medications are either weak acids or weak bases. An Acid Medium is absorbed more easily in na acidic environment and vis versa, and Medium Alkaline medication is absorbed more easily in Alkaline Environments. For Example, Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic acid) is an acid based medication that abosrbs well in the stomach.\nSummary:\n\nBlood Flow to the Area\nSurface Area available for Absorption\nLipid-Solubility of the medicine\nPH of the medicine and the PH of the bosys’s internal environment\nMedicine Concentration\nStructures that the medication needs to pass through.\n\nDistribution of Medication\nDistribution of Medication\nthe moement of medications throughout the body, and occurs after absorption. Distribution is determined by Three Factors:\n\nBlood FLow to the tissues.\nThe ability of medicine to exit the circulatory system.\nThe ability of the medication to enter cells, if required.\n\nA Medications Ability to Exit the circulatory System\nAfter a medication has been delivered to the target tissue, the next step is to exit the circulatory system to produce the desired effect.\nMost medications do not evoke their effects within the blood, therefore the ability for the medication to be able to exit the circulatory system (the blood) is important.\n\nLipid Soluble Medications have a high affinity for adipose (fat) tissue, but adipose tissue has a low blood flow therefore prolonging the time the medication remains in the body.\n\nCapillary Beds make up a single layer of epithelial Cells, which enable medication molecules to move easky and quickly pass through to the interstitial space and then into target cells.\nMany medicines are bound to proeteins within the body. Medicines can be bound to plasma proteins as well as tissue proteins. The degree of meidine to protein binding often effects the efficiency of the medication. Plasma protein binfing can have mulptiple effects on the pharmacokinetics of a medication. The binding of medication to plasma proteins is the main determinant of a medicaions disposition. When a medication is bound to plasma proteins it is not activel distributed to the site of action. Furthermore, the bound medication remains in the blood, while the unbound (free) portions may be metabolised or eliminated.\nOnly Free or Unbound Medicines can intereact with receptors. therefore only free medicine molecules can produce our therapeutic affect.\nExample: Warfarin is a highly protein bound medicine that must unbind from proteins to leave the blood. If a patient who takes Warfarin experiences a change in protein level, as a result of liver cirrhosis or malnutrition, the warfarin dose must be adjusted to take this into account.\nAbility of Medicine to enter the Cells\nSome medications must enter the cell to reach their site of action and most medicines must enter cells to undergo metabolism and elimination. This is affected by a transport system being in place and the lipid solubility of the medication.\nPassing The Blood Brain Barrier..\nOnly very lipid (dar?? can enter the brain\nMetabolism\nWhat is metabolism?\nMetabolism involves enzymes. Most medications undergo chemical modification to create compounds, known as metabolites, that are easily eliminated from the body. Metabolites may be more or less active than the original medicne, and they can make the medicine more water-soluble to facilitate elimination. These chemical modifications occur primarily in the liver.\nFirst Pass Effect\nThe First Pass effect is a process in which the liver can partially or completely inactivate a medication before it reaches the systemic circulation. For medicines adminstered Orally, Absorbe from the GI tract, and transported to the liver, Via the Hepatic Portal Vein, this may result in none or only a small portion of the active medicaiton reaching the systemic cicrulation and the intended target tissue or organ. This process can be protective, as it enables the liver to in-activate medications that are potentially harmful before they are distributed throughout the body.\nIf it is a medicaiton that requires a therapeutic affect, Then this process can be bypassed by administering the medication parentarally.\nFactors Influencing Metabolism\nAge\nIn infancy, the liver is not fully developed, therefore the ability to metabolize is limited. INfants up to one yea if age are sensitive to some medicines.\nNutrition\nMedicines metabolized by the liver require many cofactors to be able to metabolise effectively. If a patient is malnourished, these co-factors may be deficient, and metabolism will be compromised.\nCompetition between Medications\n\nWhen tow medicines are metabolised by the same metabolic pathway, they tend to compet. This decrease the rate at which one or both medicines are being metaboliszed and can lead do medicine accumulation.\nFor example, alcohol metabolism uses up a key component in the metabolism of paracetamol If too much alchohol has been ingested too close to paracetamol administration, paracetamol cannot be broken down via its normal mechanism. This can lead to toxic damage witihn the liver.\n\nElimination\nElimination is the removal of medicine from the body. All medicines are eventually Elimanated. Medicines may be eliminated in the unchanged form or after being metabolised and effectively changed. They can be eleciminated in urine, bile, exhaled air, saliva, sweat, breast mil, or faeces. Most water-soluble medicines and their metabolites are eliminated by the kidneys in urine.\n\nSaliva - Exhaled Air - Breast Milk - Sweat - Bile - Faeces - Urine\n\nDisease processes\nDisease Processes which affect liver and kidney function , the organs of medication elimination, are responsible for large variations in pharmacokinetics.\nMedicine Classifications\nACE Inhibitors\nmedications that inhibit the activity of the angiotenzin converting enxyme, ACE, which causes blood vessels to dilate, resulting in lowered blood pressure. Examples of ACE Inhibitors include cilzapril, lisinopril, captopril, and quinapril\nAlpha And Beta - adrenergic antagonists\nAre medications that stimulate both alpha and beta receptors causing dilaton of bronchioles and constriction of blood vessels. Adrenaline is an example of this medication.\n\nRemember, Alpha Receptors cause Contriction, and Beta Receptors cause Dilation\n\nAnalagesics Include NSAIDS And Opoids…\nNSAIDS ( Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs)\nare a group of anti- inflammatory medicines that are used to relieve pain, such as Ibuprofen and diclofenac.\nOpoids\nsuch as Morphine and fentanyl, bind to opiate receptor sites in the brain and spinal cord. They block the transmission of pain messages to the brain therefore reducing the feeeling of pain.\ngraph TD\n  A[1. Painful Stimuli] -- Spinal Cord Takes message to the brain --&gt; B[Brain]\n\nAngioTensin 2 Blockers\nAngiotensin 2 Blockers are medicines which block the action of the hormone angiotensin 2, resulting in decreased blood pressure. Angion tensin 2 Blockers prevent angiotensin 2 from binding to its receptors on the muscles surroung blood vessels. This results in vasodilation which reduces blood pressure. These blockers have similar effects to those of ACE Inhibitors and are commonly used when a patient can not tolerate an ACE Inhibitor. Examples of AngioTensin 2 Blockers include candesarten and Losartan.\nAntibiotics\nUsed to treat bacterial infections, They Inhibit the growth of, or destroy, bacterial micro-organisms. They can be further classified..\nPenicillin Based\nPenicillin based Medications, Such As amoxicillin, are beta-lactam antibiotics which have a broad activity against many bacteria. Many Bacteria are resistant to amoxicillin due to their ability to produce the enxyme beta-lactamaze, which destroys the active part of beta-lactam antibiotics. Co-amoxiclav contains amoxicillin and claculanic acid. The clavulanic acid inhibits the beta-lactamaze enzymēso that the amoxicillin can effectively kill the bacteria.\nCephalosporions\nCephalosporins are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics. They have a broad activity agains bacteria and are less susceptible to the enxyme beta-lactamze. Cephalosporions are used for patients that have a severe allergy to penicillin antibiotics. An example is Ceftriaxone.\nAnti-coagulants\nmedicines that interrupt the blood clotting process, and help prevent blood clots, such as Warfarin, and Heparin (Not Aspirin, which is an anti-platelet).\nAntiemetics\nmedicines that are effective in the suppresssion of nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron is an anti-emetic.\nAntihistamines\nanatagonise (block) the action of histamine. Histamine is responsible for immediate hypersensitibity reactions such as itching and sneezing. Loratadine is an example of an antiHistamine.\nAntiplatelets\nAntiplatelet Medicines\nBeta Blockers\nare medications that block the effect of beta-adregeneric substances. They Stopy the heart rate increasing and limit the force which which the heart contracts which in turn reduces blood pressure. Names of these medicines comomnly end in “lol”. Examples include Metroprolol, atenolol, bisoprolol, and sotalol.\nBronchodilators.\nCause dilation of the bronchioles. Examples of Bronchodilators are salbulatamol and Ipratropium. In the out- of hospital environment, bronchodilators are adminsitered for shortness of breath, caused by bronchospasm associated with asthma or COPD.\nCalcium Channel Blockers\nCalciumc Channel blockers relax and dilate the blood vessels by affecting muscle cells in the arterial walls, resulting in decreased blood pressure. Also Known as calcium channel antagonists, They are commonly used as anti-hypertensive medications, although some classes of calcium channel blockers slow the heart rate, which enables use as treatment for angina and atrial fibriliation. Examples of Calcium channel blockers include diltiazem, verapimil, amlodipine, and felodipine.\nCorticosteroids\nInihibit the production of inflammatory mediators, resulting in a reduction in inflammatory responses. Prednsione is a corticosteroid\nDiuretics\nDiuretics increase the amount of water and salt eliminated from the body as urine. They are commonly used to treat a range of conditions, such as hypertension, heart failure, and oedema. There are several classes of diuretic, but the individual classes are not important. Examples of diuretics include frusemide, bendrofluazide, and spironolactone.\nOral Hypoglycaemics\nOral Hypoglycaemics reduce the amount of glucose in the bloodstream. There are different classifications of Oral Hypoglycaemics, and each classification works in a slightly different way to manage blood glucose levels. Some increase the amount of insulin created by the pancreas, some increase the sensitivity of taget organs to insulin, some reduce the production of glucose by the liver, and some decrease the rate that glucose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Examples of commonly found Oral hypgolycaemics include gliclazide, metformin, and glipizide.\nVasodilators\ncause dilation of the blood vessels, increasing blood flow. Vasodilators are used to treat hypertension, angina, and heart failure. An example of this medication is GTN.\nReview Questions\nRecap Questions\n\nWhat is Osmosis?\nWhat is diffusion?\nWhat is active transport?\n\nQuestions about Pharmacology\n\n\nWhat is the difference between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics?\n\n\nWrite out the Definitions we have learnt from this page.\n\n\nWhy do we do multiple dosing?\n\n\nWhat are factors that influence biavailability?\n\n\nDistribution is determined by:\n\n\nWhat is the primary site of metabolism?\n\n\nWhat is the first pass effect?\n\n\nWhat are factors that influence metabolism?\n\n\nWhat routes of elimination are there?\n\n\nA medicine that produces a parasympathetic response is called … because…\n\n\nA medicine that produces a sympathetic response is called … because…\n\n\nWhat is the difference between Parental and Enteral Routes of Medication?\n\n\nWhat effect does Shock Has on the Different Route’s Of Medication?
